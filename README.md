Web App for finding groups to play D&D

A brief history is given on the game itself, and the benefits of playing.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, Javascript

Ideas for improvement: 
1. Practice, there are a lot of things I don't know that only practice will be able to rememdy. 
2. Gain more familiarity with JS as my knowledge in that is definitely lacking and it shows in the static nature of the website. 
3. Work to incorporate more CSS design elements that don't necessarily revolve around specific html content.
