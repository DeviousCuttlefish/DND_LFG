			<h4>More People are Playing D&D Than Ever Before</h4>
			<p>One of the hardest parts of getting into the expansive world of D&D isâ€¦ well, finding other people to play with. Maybe you live far away from other prospective players, your schedule doesn't always line up with your friends', or you don't normally meet new friends face to face, there are numerous roadblocks to getting a party together and going forth to find adventure! Fortunately, this service is meant to alleviate that issue, and get you back into world as quickly as possible. The fact that more people than ever before are playing this game also doesn't hurt!</p>

			<p>So, you've used the service and found a group of like-minded party members to play with, but now there's just one thing missing. A Dungeon Master! As the lynchpin of every TTRPG, you won't get far without your own DM to run the adventures for you! That's why we've added the option for our base of adventurers to take up the mantle of DM and give this community of players beacons to rally around. To this end, we've created a database of both players and DMs so that we can pair groups of players with DMs of the appropriate level and get their games off the ground without players needing to search for a DM themselves.</p>

			<h4>It's Time to Start Playing</h4>
			<p>Playing with people you've never met in person can be daunting and sometimes even a deal breaker. We've all heard or read the horror stories online (thanks reddit) and we're worried that we'll encounter something terrible if we put ourselves out there to play this game we all love. It's true, there are undoubtedly individuals that might sully your gaming experience out there. However, for every one that creates negativity, there are a dozen phenominal players out there that will elevate your game into the stratosphere! Just like the game we play, sometimes you just have to roll the dice and see what happens!</p>
